## Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

This program takes in a text file with an expression written in Reverse Polish 
Notation (RPN) and outputs the result.

It utilizes the stack data strcuture (LIFO) to perform the calculations. By 
pushing numbers onto a stack and popping them off when an operator is detected,
this program is able to perform calculations with the "+", "-", "*" and "/" 
operators.
